1) We need to print the number of set bits in all numbers till the given number as an array
2) We use dynamic programming to keep track of all the outputs so far, and use the formula to calculate current value
3) If current value is even, it's value will be the same as half it's value: x/2
4) If current value is odd, then it's value will be 1 more than the half it's value: 1 + x/2
