1) The intervals given need to be checked and determine the minimum number of intervals that can be removed to keep other intervals non-overlapping
2) To get just he count of the intervals, not the first interval's end value
3) If subsequent interval's start value is greater than this end value then update the end value and increment counter
4) The count at the end gives minimum number of intervals to remove to
