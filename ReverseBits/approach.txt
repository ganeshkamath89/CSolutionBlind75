1) We use a mask of 1 to determine whether the number's bit is set or not
2) We loop the number for all 32 digits and check which all bits are set
3) When ever bits are set while checking form right to left, that bit is bitwise-ORed from another nuber's left to right
4) The new number formed has reversed bits of the original number
