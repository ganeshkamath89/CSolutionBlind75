1) use a variable maxSum initialized to initial element
2) use a variable curSum to add elements till current index
3) The curSum variable resets to 0 when ever its value becomes less than 0 as -ve numbers do not contribute to maximumSum
4) the max of curSum and maxSum in each iteration gives the overall maximum sum of the subarray

Note: in the naive approach we need 3 loops i, j, k index to form sum of all sub arrays and find the highest possible max value
