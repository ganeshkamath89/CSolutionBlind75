Use 1 min-Heap, 1 max-heap
1) max heap runs from beginning to the middle so the maximum value of the heap is tracked
2) min heap runs from middle to the end, so the minimum value of the heap is tracked

For a stream with even number of values, median = (minheap.top() + maxheap.top())/2
For a stream with odd number of values, median = maxheap.top()
