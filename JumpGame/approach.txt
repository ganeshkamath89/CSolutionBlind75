1) We initialize a variable "reachable" that keeps track of maximum distance reachable as we iterate over all the index
2) At each point we get the maximum of the reachable value so far and "i + arr[i]" which tells the reachability of element at index i
3) The maximum reachable value at the end of interation tells us if we can reach the end or not.
