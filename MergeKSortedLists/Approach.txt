1) Create a minheap
2) Initially populate the value of first node of all K sorted linked lists to the heap
3) Pop out the top element and print it
4) Increment the pointer of the linked list form the tracked linked list where the top element is popped
5) If the tracked list hit null, then don't add further elements from that list to heap
6) Once all elements are popped, we have printed out the K sorted elements sorted on the screen output
