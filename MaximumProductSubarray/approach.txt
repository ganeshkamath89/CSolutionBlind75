1) product of all positive numbers give positive output
2) product of all negative numbers can give either positive or negative output
3) When a number is multiplied by 0, it becomes 0, so 0 splits the array into smaller reset points
4) We need to keep track of both max and min possible value upon multiplication and use that value to get the maximum product subarray value
