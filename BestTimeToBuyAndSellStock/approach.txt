1) Use the L, R Sliding window technique
2) Initialize L to 0 and R to 1 and maxProfit to 0
3) If price at L is less than R the note the profit and compare against maxProfit
4) If the value is greater then maxProfit, then note down the buy and sell indices
5) If price of L is more than price of R, make L = R to advance the L pointer forward
6) In the end of each iteration, R pointer keeps moving forward till all elements are covered
